                    I am an avid music lover. When it comes to music, I love listening to it and creating it. I pride himself on my vast CD collection that has many different genres that represent different eras or memories throughout my life. As for music creation, I first started when I formed a band with my high school friends and then it progressed as a solo hobby. I love creating music with my guitar and piano. I built a home studio and learned to record myself, but I don't have the courage to publish anything seriously yet. I first learned ProTools but ever since switching to Mac, I enjoy making music in Logic Pro. My top bands are Foo Fighters and Paramore. I also have a strong appreciation for artists who use 70's or 80's influence into their songs and appreciates the craft in creating a radio pop hit.

                    I am an avid theme park lover and have traveled to theme parks around the US. My favorite thus far is Disneyland in California because of the mixture of fun but with the food influence of LA. Roller coasters are also something I do not shy away from, but my least favorites are kid roller coasters because of the small clearances like in Goofy's Sky School.

                    I love traveling. I used to move around a lot so I enjoyed traveling to new places. Most of my travels have been local but I hope to travel globally soon. I will say though my favorite trips are those I take to the west coast. Having been on both coasts, I can confidently say In-N-Out Burger is the best burger chain.
