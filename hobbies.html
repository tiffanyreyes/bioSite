                    Miguel is an avid music lover. When it comes to music, He loves listening to it and creating it. He prides himself on his vast CD collection that has many different genres that represent different eras or memories throughout his life. As for music creation, he first started when he formed a band with his high school friends and then it progressed as a solo hobby. He loves creating music with his guitar and piano. He built a home studio and learned to record himself, but he doesn't have the courage to publish anything seriously yet. He first learned ProTools but ever since switching to Mac, he enjoys making music in Logic Pro. His top bands are Foo Fighters and Paramore. He also has a strong appreciation for artists who use 70's or 80's influence into their songs and appreciates the craft in creating a radio pop hit.
